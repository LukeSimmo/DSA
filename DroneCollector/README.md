# DroneCollector

A program to model a series of shops to be visited by a drone to collect items, there is a purchase order of items to collect.
The program reads in data on the inventories, stores, catalogue, and purchase orders and stores them in appropriate ADTs.

The focus of this project was to use my own ADT implementations: graph, linkedlist, hashmap, hashtable to complete the task
